# Complete Workflow Guide: Full University Timetable Generation

## 🎯 **Overview**

This guide explains how the system works when you import full university data and generate timetables for the entire university using the new scalable per-faculty approach.

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **PHASE 1: Data Import (One-Time Setup)**

#### **Step 1: Import All University Data**

Import your data in this order:

1. **Import Time Slots** (if not already done)
   ```
   POST /api/import/time-slots
   ```
   - Defines when classes can be scheduled (e.g., 9:00-11:00, 14:00-16:00)
   - Required before generating any timetables

2. **Import Rooms**
   ```
   POST /api/import/rooms
   ```
   - All university rooms (shared across all faculties)
   - Example: L201 (Lab, 60 capacity), T301 (Theory, 100 capacity)

3. **Import Lecturers**
   ```
   POST /api/import/lecturers
   ```
   - All university lecturers (can teach across faculties)
   - Each lecturer has: ID, name, role, faculty, specializations, availability

4. **Import Course Units (Subjects)**
   ```
   POST /api/import/subjects
   ```
   - All courses offered across all programs
   - Example: BIT1101, BCS1101, BBA1101

5. **Import Programs** ⭐ **NOW WITH FACULTY FIELD**
   ```
   POST /api/import/programs
   ```
   - **Your data must include "Faculty" column**
   - Example data structure:
     ```
     Program Code | Program Name | Faculty | Batch | Semester | Student Size | Subjects
     BSCAIT       | Bachelor...   | ICT     | 1     | S1       | 32           | BIT1101, BIT1102...
     BBA          | Bachelor...   | Business| 1     | S1       | 80           | BBA1101, BBA1102...
     ```
   - System automatically:
     - Extracts faculty from "Faculty" column
     - Normalizes faculty names (e.g., "Business" → "Business & Commerce")
     - Infers faculty from program code if missing (backward compatibility)
     - Saves faculty with each program record

6. **Import Canonical Course Groups** (Optional but recommended)
   ```
   POST /api/import/canonical-groups
   ```
   - Groups equivalent courses across programs
   - Example: BIT1101 and BCS1101 are the same course

---

### **PHASE 2: Timetable Generation (Per Term)**

#### **Option A: Generate All Faculties at Once (Recommended)**

**Single API Call:**
```bash
POST /api/timetable/generate/all-faculties
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "term": 1,
    "academic_year": "2024-2025"
}
```

**What Happens:**
1. System finds all unique faculties from programs
2. Generates timetables sequentially:
   - **Faculty 1 (e.g., ICT):**
     - Loads all ICT programs
     - CSP solver generates timetable
     - Saves all assignments to database
     - Books all rooms/lecturers globally
   
   - **Faculty 2 (e.g., Business):**
     - Loads all Business programs
     - **CSP solver automatically sees ICT's bookings**
     - Avoids conflicts automatically
     - Generates timetable
     - Saves and books resources
   
   - **Faculty 3, 4, 5...** (same process)
     - Each faculty is aware of all previous bookings
     - Zero conflicts guaranteed!

**Result:**
- Complete university timetable for Term 1
- All faculties scheduled
- No conflicts between faculties
- All data saved in database

---

#### **Option B: Generate Faculties One at a Time (More Control)**

**Generate ICT First:**
```bash
POST /api/timetable/generate/faculty
{
    "term": 1,
    "faculty": "ICT",
    "academic_year": "2024-2025"
}
```

**Generate Business Next:**
```bash
POST /api/timetable/generate/faculty
{
    "term": 1,
    "faculty": "Business & Commerce",
    "academic_year": "2024-2025"
}
```

**Continue for other faculties...**

**Benefits:**
- Can review each faculty's timetable before generating next
- Can regenerate specific faculty if needed
- More control over the process

---

### **PHASE 3: Viewing and Managing Timetables**

#### **View Generated Timetables**

1. **List All Timetables:**
   ```
   GET /api/timetable/list
   ```

2. **Get Specific Timetable:**
   ```
   GET /api/timetable/{timetable_id}
   ```

3. **Check Resource Availability:**
   ```
   GET /api/timetable/resources/availability?term=1&resource_type=room&resource_id=L201
   ```

---

## 🔄 **Complete Example: Full University Setup**

### **Scenario: University with 5 Faculties, 25 Programs**

**Data Structure:**
```
Faculty: ICT
  - BSCAIT (6 semesters × 2 batches = 12 programs)
  - BSCCS (6 semesters × 2 batches = 12 programs)
  - BIT (6 semesters × 1 batch = 6 programs)
Total: 30 programs

Faculty: Business & Commerce
  - BBA (6 semesters × 2 batches = 12 programs)
  - BSC.AF (6 semesters × 1 batch = 6 programs)
Total: 18 programs

Faculty: Engineering
  - BSCE (6 semesters × 1 batch = 6 programs)
Total: 6 programs

Faculty: Arts
  - BA (6 semesters × 1 batch = 6 programs)
Total: 6 programs

Faculty: Science
  - BSC (6 semesters × 1 batch = 6 programs)
Total: 6 programs

GRAND TOTAL: 66 programs across 5 faculties
```

### **Workflow:**

#### **1. Import All Data (One Time)**
```bash
# Import time slots
POST /api/import/time-slots
[Time slot data...]

# Import rooms (shared across all faculties)
POST /api/import/rooms
[Room data...]

# Import lecturers (can teach across faculties)
POST /api/import/lecturers
[Lecturer data...]

# Import courses

## 📊 **Database Collections After Generation**

### **timetable_assignments**
Contains all scheduled sessions:
```json
{
    "session_id": "VAR_123",
    "term": "Term1",
    "academic_year": "2024-2025",
    "faculty": "ICT",
    "program_id": "BSCAIT_1_S1",
    "course_id": "BIT1101",
    "lecturer_id": "L001",
    "room_number": "L201",
    "day": "MON",
    "period": "SLOT_1",
    "start_time": "09:00",
    "end_time": "11:00",
    "status": "confirmed"
}
```

### **resource_bookings**
Fast conflict checking:
```json
{
    "resource_type": "room",
    "resource_id": "L201",
    "term": "Term1",
    "day": "MON",
    "period": "SLOT_1",
    "is_booked": true,
    "faculty": "ICT"
}
```

---

## 🔍 **How Conflict Prevention Works**

### **Example Scenario:**

**ICT Faculty Generation:**
- Assigns Room L201 on Monday 9:00-11:00
- System saves booking: `{room: L201, day: MON, period: SLOT_1, faculty: ICT}`

**Business Faculty Generation (Next):**
- CSP solver tries to assign Room L201 on Monday 9:00-11:00
- System checks: "Is L201 available on MON SLOT_1?"
- Database query: Finds ICT's booking
- Result: **Room not available** → CSP tries next option
- CSP automatically finds alternative (e.g., L202 or different time)
- ✅ **No conflict!**

**Same for Lecturers:**
- Lecturer L001 assigned to ICT on Monday 9:00-11:00
- Business tries to assign L001 at same time
- System detects conflict → CSP finds alternative lecturer or time
- ✅ **No conflict!**
